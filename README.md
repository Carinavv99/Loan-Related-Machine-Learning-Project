ML Analytics Loan Application Analysis Report

Title: Data Analysis and Modeling for Business Intelligence

Executive Summary
The project aimed at enhancing ABC Loans' ability to predict loan defaults using machine learning (ML) techniques. After evaluating various algorithms on provided datasets, LightGBM and CatBoost were identified as top performers, offering high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. These models are recommended for integration into ABC Loans' operational framework to improve loan default prediction and risk management.
Introduction
As a loan business ABC Loans is looking to reduce the impact loan defaults have on their bottom line by creating a tool that better predicts loan defaults. The goal is to deliver to ABC Loans the best predictive model and provide further analysis of business use cases as they relate to risk  assessment and gender. The outlined project deliverables are as follows,
●	Identify the best classifier to utilize for predicting defaulting on a loan.
●	Recommend the best modeling classifiers based on business use cases.
●	Provide recommendations for risk assessment and gender business use cases.
Methodology
Outlined below is an overview of the data and methodologies undertaken to collect, prepare, model and analyze the loan data. The analysis undertook the modeling of nine different models, which were further refined and optimized for comparison and selection of the best performing models were identified. 

●	Data Source: Sourced from Kaggle 'application_data.csv' and 'previous_application.csv'.
●	Data Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis, such as removing columns with excessive null values, dropping rows with null values, and converting categorical variables into a usable format.
●	Model Selection and Training: Overview of the ML algorithms evaluated, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Booster Classifier, XG Booster, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
●	Model Evaluation: Criteria for model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC) and optimization strategies employed.
Results
There were several takeaways noted from the results. Performance metrics identified and presented several different classifiers/models to be utilized based on the business case. 

●	Model Performance: Performance metrics for each evaluated model were presented. It identified the performance of LightGBM and CatBoost in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC as the best.
●	The LightGBM model demonstrates superior performance in accuracy, precision, and overall classification, making it highly effective for predicting loan defaults.
●	The CatBoost model, with its high recall, effectively identifies a majority of actual defaulted loans, complementing the predictive power of the LightGBM model.
●	Use Case 1 - Risk Assessment: Analysis showing LightGBM is the best in predicting defaults for 'Repairs' loan types.
●	Use Case 2 - Comparing gender based dataset: Results showed that the dataset with the combined genders was a better predictor of loan defaults than the gender specific data sets. The male dataset was better at identifying male defaults.   
●	ROC AUC Curve Analysis: Detailed analysis of LightGBM's ROC AUC curve, emphasizing its optimal threshold for minimizing false positives in loan default prediction.
Recommendations
ML Analytics has outlined the following recommendations based on the analysis of the provided loan data. 

●	For ABC Loans: Incorporate LightGBM for risk assessment and loan approval processes, particularly for ‘Repairs’ loan applications, to leverage its accuracy and precision in predicting defaults. The LightGBM model is ideal for correctly predicting default loans, which is crucial for assessing risk. It can also be incorporated into the loan approval process to inform decisions about who to lend to.
●	Personalized Loan Offers: Using the LightGBM or CatBoost models can help predict the risk of missed payments, allowing the company to offer more favorable terms to lower-risk applicants.
●	Early Intervention Strategies: Implement early intervention strategies using the CatBoost model. This model is effective at correctly identifying most of the actual missed payments, allowing the company to implement strategies like financial counseling or flexible repayment plans for high-risk applicants.
●	Operational Integration: Suggestions for integrating predictive models into ABC Loans’ existing IT infrastructure for automated decision-making and policy development. Automate part of the decision-making process using the LightGBM or CatBoost models. These models’ high performance can speed up the loan approval process and reduce the workload of loan officers.
●	Policy Development: Use the LightGBM or CatBoost models to inform company policies. The insights gained from these models can help the company adjust its policies to reduce the risk of missed payments.
●	Future Research: Encourage further exploration into model performance across different loan types and borrower demographics to refine predictive capabilities.
●	Review the loan process to confirm that there are no biases in the data collection.  

Conclusion
The project's findings underscore the potential of machine learning to revolutionize loan default prediction. By adopting LightGBM or CatBoost, ABC Loans can significantly enhance its risk assessment strategies, leading to more informed lending decisions and reduced default rates. The comprehensive approach, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, lays a solid foundation for future advancements in predictive analytics within the financial industry.
